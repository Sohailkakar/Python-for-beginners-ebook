# Chapter 13: Build a To-Do List App – Your First Complete Application

# In this final project, you’ll build a simple To-Do List app that allows users to:
# - Add tasks
# - View tasks
# - Remove tasks
# - Exit the app

# We’ll use:
# - Lists to store tasks
# - Loops for interaction
# - Functions to keep code organised
# - File handling to save and load tasks


# Function to load tasks from file
def load_tasks():
    try:
        with open("tasks.txt", "r") as file:
            tasks = [line.strip() for line in file.readlines()]
        return tasks
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return []

# Function to save tasks to file
def save_tasks(tasks):
    with open("tasks.txt", "w") as file:
        for task in tasks:
            file.write(task + "\n")

# Function to display tasks
def show_tasks(tasks):
    if not tasks:
        print(" Your to-do list is empty.")
    else:
        print("\n Your To-Do List:")
        for idx, task in enumerate(tasks, start=1):
            print(f"{idx}. {task}")

# Main function to run the To-Do List App
def todo_app():
    tasks = load_tasks()

    print("\n Welcome to Your To-Do List App!")

    while True:
        print("\nChoose an option:")
        print("1. View tasks")
        print("2. Add task")
        print("3. Remove task")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter choice (1-4): ")

        if choice == "1":
            show_tasks(tasks)

        elif choice == "2":
            new_task = input("Enter your new task: ").strip()
            if new_task:
                tasks.append(new_task)
                save_tasks(tasks)
                print(" Task added!")

        elif choice == "3":
            show_tasks(tasks)
            try:
                task_number = int(input("Enter task number to remove: "))
                if 1 <= task_number <= len(tasks):
                    removed_task = tasks.pop(task_number - 1)
                    save_tasks(tasks)
                    print(f" Removed: {removed_task}")
                else:
                    print("Invalid task number.")
            except ValueError:
                print("Please enter a valid number.")

        elif choice == "4":
            print(" Goodbye! Your tasks are saved.")
            break

        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

# Run the To-Do App
todo_app()

# In this chapter, you brought together everything you’ve learned:
# - Lists, loops, conditionals, functions, file handling, and user input.
# This is your first real app—and the beginning of many more to come!

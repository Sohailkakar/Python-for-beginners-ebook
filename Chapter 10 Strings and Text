# Chapter 9: Strings and Text ‚Äì Playing with Words in Python

# In Python, strings are pieces of text written inside quotes.

# Example 1: Basic string and printing
message = "Hello, Python!"
print(message)

# Example 2: String concatenation (joining)
first_name = "Sohail"
last_name = "Ahmed"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print("Full Name:", full_name)

# Example 3: Using f-strings for cleaner formatting
age = 25
print(f"My name is {full_name} and I am {age} years old.")

# Example 4: String methods
text = "python programming"

print(text.upper())     # Converts to uppercase
print(text.lower())     # Converts to lowercase
print(text.title())     # Capitalises each word
print(text.replace("python", "Java"))  # Replaces text
print(len(text))        # Length of string

# Example 5: Checking content in strings
if "python" in text:
    print("The word 'python' is present.")

# Example 6: Splitting and joining strings
sentence = "I love learning Python"
words = sentence.split()
print("Words:", words)

joined_sentence = " ".join(words)
print("Joined back:", joined_sentence)

# In this chapter, you learned:
# - String basics, concatenation, formatting
# - String methods: upper, lower, replace, title
# - Splitting and joining strings


# üõ†Ô∏è Mini Project: Word Counter App

# This project asks the user to enter a sentence and tells them how many words they wrote.

print("\n Welcome to the Word Counter App!")

user_sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")

# Splitting the sentence into words
words_list = user_sentence.split()

# Counting words
word_count = len(words_list)

print(f"Your sentence has {word_count} words.")

# Bonus: Showing each word separately
print("\nHere are the words you entered:")
for word in words_list:
    print("-", word)

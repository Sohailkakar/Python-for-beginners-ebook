# Chapter 1: Hello Python

# This is your very first Python program.
# The 'print()' function is used to display text on the screen.

print("Hello, World!")

# In Python, you can print any message by writing it inside the print() function and using quotation marks.
# You can use either single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ") for text (they both work).

print('Welcome to Python Programming!')

# You can also print numbers directly.
print(123)

# Let's print a simple math calculation.
print(5 + 3)  # This will print: 8

# Python ignores anything written after the '#' symbol.
# These are called 'comments' and are useful for explaining your code.

# Let's try printing multiple messages:
print("Learning Python is fun!")
print("You're going to build real projects step by step.")
print("Let's keep going!")

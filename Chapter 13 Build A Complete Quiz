# Chapter 12: Building a Quiz Game – Test What You’ve Learned

# In this chapter, you’ll combine everything you’ve learned so far to build a simple Quiz Game.
# You'll use variables, lists, loops, conditionals, and input/output.

# Let's start by creating the questions and answers.

questions = [
    {
        "question": "What does CPU stand for?",
        "options": ["Central Processing Unit", "Computer Personal Unit", "Central Programming Unit"],
        "answer": "Central Processing Unit"
    },
    {
        "question": "Which keyword is used to define a function in Python?",
        "options": ["func", "define", "def"],
        "answer": "def"
    },
    {
        "question": "Which data type is used to store True or False?",
        "options": ["String", "Boolean", "Integer"],
        "answer": "Boolean"
    }
]

# We will create a function to run the quiz
def run_quiz(questions):
    score = 0  # To keep track of correct answers

    for q in questions:
        print("\n" + q["question"])
        for idx, option in enumerate(q["options"], start=1):
            print(f"{idx}. {option}")

        try:
            choice = int(input("Enter your choice (1/2/3): "))
            if q["options"][choice - 1].lower() == q["answer"].lower():
                print(" Correct!")
                score += 1
            else:
                print(f" Incorrect. The correct answer was: {q['answer']}")
        except (ValueError, IndexError):
            print(" Invalid input. Moving to the next question.")

    print(f"\nYour final score is: {score} out of {len(questions)}")

    if score == len(questions):
        print(" Excellent! You got all answers right.")
    elif score > 0:
        print(" Good effort! Keep practising.")
    else:
        print(" Don’t worry, review the chapters and try again.")

# Running the quiz
print(" Welcome to the Python Quiz Game!")
run_quiz(questions)

# In this chapter, you learned:
# - How to store multiple questions using lists and dictionaries
# - How to create a function that handles a complete interactive quiz
# - How to use loops, conditionals, and inputs together in one project

# Chapter 2: Variables and Data Types

# In Python, a variable is like a container where you can store information (data).
# You can name the variable and assign it a value using the '=' symbol.

# Example: Storing your name in a variable
name = "Sohail"

# Printing the value of the variable
print("My name is:", name)

# You can also store numbers
age = 25
print("I am", age, "years old.")

# Variables can store different types of data:
# String → text (inside quotes)
# Integer → whole numbers
# Float → decimal numbers
# Boolean → True or False

# Example of all basic data types:
city = "Karachi"            # String
year = 2025                 # Integer
temperature = 36.5          # Float
is_student = True           # Boolean

# Printing all variables
print("City:", city)
print("Year:", year)
print("Temperature:", temperature)
print("Are you a student?", is_student)

# You can also update the value of a variable
age = 26
print("Next year I will be:", age)

# Python is case-sensitive, so 'Age' and 'age' are different variables:
Age = 30
print("Age with capital A:", Age)
print("Age with small a:", age)

# Let's practise basic math with variables:
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
total = num1 + num2
print("Total is:", total)

difference = num1 - num2
print("Difference is:", difference)

product = num1 * num2
print("Product is:", product)

quotient = num1 / num2
print("Quotient is:", quotient)

# Remember:
# Use meaningful variable names so your code is easy to understand.

# That's the basics of variables and data types!

# Chapter 10: File Handling ‚Äì Saving and Reading Data from Files

# File handling allows us to save information so that it can be used later, even after the program ends.

# Example 1: Writing to a file (this will create the file if it doesn't exist)
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, this is my first file!\n")
    file.write("I am learning how to save data in Python.")

# The "w" mode means write. It will overwrite the file if it already exists.

# Example 2: Appending data to an existing file
with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\nThis line was added later.")

# The "a" mode means append‚Äîit adds new content without deleting old content.

# Example 3: Reading data from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("\nFile Content:\n")
    print(content)

# Example 4: Reading file line by line
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())

# In this chapter, you learned:
# - How to write to a file
# - How to append to a file
# - How to read from a file
# - Why it's important to use 'with' (it automatically closes the file)

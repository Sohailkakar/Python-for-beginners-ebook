# Chapter 5: Loops â€“ Doing Things Again and Again

# Loops allow us to repeat actions multiple times without writing the same code over and over.

# Example 1: Using a while loop
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1

# The loop runs as long as the condition (count <= 5) is True.

# Example 2: Using a for loop with range()
for i in range(1, 6):
    print("Number:", i)

# The range(1, 6) generates numbers from 1 to 5.

# Example 3: Looping through a string
for letter in "Python":
    print(letter)

# Example 4: Looping through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print("I like", fruit)

# Example 5: Using break and continue
for num in range(1, 10):
    if num == 5:
        print("Stopping at number", num)
        break  # Exits the loop
    print(num)

for num in range(1, 10):
    if num == 5:
        continue  # Skips the rest of this loop
    print(num)

# In this chapter, you learned:
# - while loops
# - for loops
# - range()
# - break and continue

# Chapter 3: Taking Input from Users

# In Python, we can ask the user to enter something by using the 'input()' function.

# Example: Asking the user's name
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello,", name)

# The input() function **always returns text (called a 'string')**.

# Example: Asking the user's age (but still treated as text)
age = input("How old are you? ")
print("You are", age, "years old.")

# If we want to do **math** with the user's input, we must **convert the input to a number**.

# Example: Adding numbers after converting input
num1 = input("Enter the first number: ")
num2 = input("Enter the second number: ")

# Convert the input from string to integer using int()
num1 = int(num1)
num2 = int(num2)

total = num1 + num2
print("The total is:", total)

# Alternatively, you can convert to float if you expect decimal numbers:
price = float(input("Enter the price of an item: "))
quantity = int(input("Enter how many items: "))
total_price = price * quantity
print("Total price is:", total_price)

# Another example: Creating a short introduction using multiple inputs
first_name = input("Enter your first name: ")
city = input("Enter your city: ")

print("Nice to meet you,", first_name + " from " + city + "!")

# Thatâ€™s the basics of taking input, converting data types, and displaying results!

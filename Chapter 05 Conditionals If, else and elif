# Chapter 4: Making Decisions with if Statements

# In Python, 'if' statements help us make decisions based on conditions.

# Example 1: Simple if statement
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are under 18.")

# The 'if' block runs if the condition is True.
# The 'else' block runs if the condition is False.

# Example 2: Using elif for multiple choices
temperature = int(input("Enter the current temperature: "))

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's a hot day.")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("It's a nice day.")
elif temperature > 10:
    print("It's a bit cold.")
else:
    print("It's very cold!")

# Example 3: Checking user input with if statements
answer = input("Do you like Python? (yes/no): ")

if answer.lower() == "yes":
    print("That's awesome!")
elif answer.lower() == "no":
    print("Give it some time, you might enjoy it!")
else:
    print("I didn't understand your answer.")

# Example 4: Using logical operators (and, or)
user = input("Enter username: ")
password = input("Enter password: ")

if user == "admin" and password == "1234":
    print("Login successful!")
else:
    print("Incorrect username or password.")

# Example 5: Using 'not' operator
logged_in = False

if not logged_in:
    print("Please log in to continue.")

# In this chapter, we learned:
# - How to write 'if', 'elif', and 'else' blocks
# - How to use comparison operators (==, >, <, >=, <=)
# - How to use logical operators (and, or, not)

# These decision-making skills are the foundation for creating interactive programs.

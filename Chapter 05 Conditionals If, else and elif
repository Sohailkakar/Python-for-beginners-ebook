# Chapter 5: Making Decisions with Conditional Statements
# =======================================================

# What are Conditional Statements?
# --------------------------------
# Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions and execute different
# code based on whether certain conditions are True or False.
# Think of them as the "brain" of your program - they help it think and choose!

# Basic if Statement
# ------------------
# The simplest form of decision-making

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
    print("You can vote and drive!")
else:
    print("You are under 18.")
    print("You need parental consent for many activities.")

# Understanding the Structure
# ---------------------------
# if condition:
#     code to run if condition is True
# else:
#     code to run if condition is False

# Comparison Operators
# --------------------
# == (equal to), != (not equal to)
# > (greater than), < (less than)
# >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to)

print("\n--- Comparison Examples ---")

num1 = 10
num2 = 5

if num1 == num2:
    print(f"{num1} equals {num2}")
elif num1 > num2:
    print(f"{num1} is greater than {num2}")
elif num1 < num2:
    print(f"{num1} is less than {num2}")
else:
    print("This should never happen!")

# Multiple Conditions with elif
# -----------------------------
# Use elif (else if) when you have multiple conditions to check

print("\n--- Weather Advisory System ---")

temperature = int(input("Enter the current temperature (°C): "))

if temperature > 35:
    print("🌡️  Extreme heat warning! Stay hydrated and avoid outdoor activities.")
elif temperature > 30:
    print("☀️  It's very hot. Wear light clothing and drink plenty of water.")
elif temperature > 25:
    print("🌤️  It's warm and pleasant. Great day for outdoor activities!")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("🌥️  It's mild. Perfect weather for a walk.")
elif temperature > 15:
    print("🌦️  It's cool. Bring a light jacket.")
elif temperature > 10:
    print("❄️  It's cold. Wear warm clothes.")

# Grade Calculator Example
# ------------------------

    message = "Needs improvement. Study more!"
else:
    grade = "F"
    message = "Failed. Please retake the test."

print(f"Grade: {grade}")
print(f"Feedback: {message}")

# Logical Operators
# -----------------
# and: Both conditions must be True
# or: At least one condition must be True
# not: Reverses the condition (True becomes False, False becomes True)

print("\n--- Logical Operators Examples ---")

# AND operator - both conditions must be True
username = input("Enter username: ")
password = input("Enter password: ")

if username == "admin" and password == "1234":
    print("✅ Login successful! Welcome, admin!")

if day == "saturday" or day == "sunday":
    print("🎉 It's the weekend! Time to relax!")
else:
    print("💼 It's a weekday. Back to work!")

# NOT operator - reverses the condition
is_logged_in = False

if not is_logged_in:
    print("🔒 Please log in to access your account.")
else:
    print("✅ You are already logged in.")

# Complex Conditions
# ------------------
print("\n--- Complex Decision Making ---")

# Age and income check for loan approval

# Complex condition with multiple checks

    print("✅ Loan approved! You meet all requirements.")

    print("❌ Loan denied: You must be 18 or older.")

# Nested if Statements

# Best Practices
# --------------
# 1. Use clear, descriptive condition names
# 2. Keep conditions simple and readable
# 3. Use parentheses to group complex conditions
# 4. Always handle the else case when appropriate
# 5. Use meaningful variable names
# 6. Add comments for complex logic

# Common Mistakes to Avoid
# ------------------------
# - Using = instead of == for comparison
# - Forgetting to convert input to appropriate type
# - Not handling all possible cases
# - Making conditions too complex

# Summary
# -------
# - if/elif/else statements make decisions in your code
# - Comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# - Logical operators: and, or, not
# - Use elif for multiple conditions
# - Always consider the else case
# - Keep conditions simple and readable
